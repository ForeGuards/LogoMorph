---

## Blockers & Questions

### Current Blockers

_None yet - just getting started!_

### Questions to Resolve

- [ ] Which SVG path commands should we support first? (M, L, C, Q, Z all at once?)
- [ ] Should path simplification be automatic or user-triggered?
- [ ] Color extraction tolerance - how similar must colors be to group?
- [ ] Template marketplace - should we implement payment integration now or later?

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Path Editing

- **Decision**: Use custom SVG path parser instead of external library
- **Rationale**: Better control and learning experience; avoids dependency
- **Alternative Considered**: svg-path-parser library

### Color Extraction

- **Decision**: Support both SVG and raster image color extraction
- **Rationale**: Users may upload either format
- **Implementation**: Use sharp for raster, XML parsing for SVG

## Notes for Tomorrow

Start with **Step 1: Create Path Editor Service**. This is the foundation for all path editing features. Focus on getting a basic parser working for simple SVG paths (M and L commands) before tackling curves.

Remember:

- Write tests as you code
- Keep files under 300 LOC
- Document design decisions
- Commit frequently with clear messages

**Good luck! 🚀**
