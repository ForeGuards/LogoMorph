## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer

```
src/services/editor/
â”œâ”€â”€ pathEditor.ts           # Vector path editing
â”œâ”€â”€ pathValidator.ts        # Path validation
â”œâ”€â”€ colorExtractor.ts       # Color extraction
â”œâ”€â”€ colorReplacer.ts        # Color replacement
â”œâ”€â”€ effectsLibrary.ts       # Visual effects (NEW)
â”œâ”€â”€ advancedMasking.ts      # Alpha channel masking (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ batchEditor.ts          # Batch operations (NEW)
```

### API Layer

```
src/api/routes/editor/
â”œâ”€â”€ pathRoutes.ts           # Path editing endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ colorRoutes.ts          # Color tool endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ effectsRoutes.ts        # Effects endpoints (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ batchRoutes.ts          # Batch operation endpoints (NEW)
```

### Authentication

All editor endpoints require Clerk authentication using `@clerk/express`:

- `requireAuth()` middleware for protected routes
- `getAuth(req)` to retrieve user context
- User ID validation for resource ownership

### Error Handling

Consistent error handling across all endpoints:

- Validation errors (400)
- Not found errors (404)
- Forbidden errors (403)
- Internal server errors (500)
- Detailed error messages in development

## API Documentation

All new endpoints are documented with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications and are available at:

- Documentation UI: `http://localhost:4000/api-docs`
- JSON Spec: `http://localhost:4000/api-docs.json`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Service layer logic testing
- Pure function testing
- Error case validation

### Integration Tests

- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- File storage integration

### End-to-End Tests

- Complete user workflows
- Cross-service operations
- Performance benchmarks

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing

- Configurable concurrency (default: 4 concurrent operations)
- Progress tracking for long-running jobs
- Graceful cancellation support
- Error isolation (one file failure doesn't stop batch)

### Effects Processing

- SVG filter-based (no raster conversion needed)
- Lazy loading of service modules
- Filter ID generation to avoid conflicts

### Masking Operations

- Efficient alpha channel extraction
- Optimized flood fill algorithm
- Vector tracing with contour simplification

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collected

- HTTP request duration
- Batch job completion times
- Effect application times
- Error rates by endpoint

### Health Checks

- Liveness probe: `GET /health`
- Readiness probe: `GET /health/ready`
- Prometheus metrics: `GET /metrics`

## Security

### Authentication

- All editor endpoints require Clerk authentication
- User ID extracted from JWT tokens
- Resource ownership validation

### Authorization

- Users can only access their own resources
- Batch jobs verified by user ID
- Organization-scoped access (future)

### Input Validation

- Type checking for all parameters
- Array bounds validation
- File format validation
- Size limit enforcement

## Next Steps

### Phase 6.2 Implementation Priorities

1. Set up Clerk Organizations integration
2. Create WebSocket server for real-time collaboration

3. WordPress plugin (large user base)
4. Figma plugin (designer workflow)

### Phase 6.4 Analytics Priorities

1. Usage analytics dashboard
2. Performance metrics tracking
3. Basic A/B testing framework
4. Export to CSV/PDF

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables required for Phase 6.1 features.

### Build & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run development server
bun --hot src/server.ts

# Run from project root
bun --hot index.ts
```

### Production Considerations

- Batch job persistence (currently in-memory)
- File cleanup for temporary batch outputs
- Rate limiting for batch endpoints
- Queue system for large batch jobs (BullMQ integration)

## Conclusion

Phase 6.1 (Advanced Editing Features) is complete with:

- âœ… Effects library with 6 preset effects
- âœ… Advanced masking with alpha channel support
- âœ… Batch editing with progress tracking
- âœ… Comprehensive API documentation
- âœ… Clerk authentication on all endpoints

Phases 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 are ready for implementation following the patterns established in Phase 6.1.
