# LogoMorph Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

LogoMorph is a web application that enables users to upload a logo and automatically generate a full suite of logo variants/assets tailored to various target formats (web, mobile, social media, favicon, app icons, etc.), with automatic layout adaptation, padding, background generation, and customization options.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (replacing Node.js, npm, pnpm)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TailwindCSS and MagicUI components
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript (migrating to Bun.serve)
- **Authentication**: Clerk for user auth and management
- **Database**: Convex for real-time data sync and backend-as-a-service
- **Caching/Queues**: Redis for job queues and caching
- **Storage**: S3/MinIO for object storage (logos and generated assets)
- **Queue System**: BullMQ for job processing
- **AI/ML**: Diffusion models for background generation
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, Kubernetes for orchestration

---

## Convex Database Integration

Convex serves as the primary database and real-time backend for LogoMorph, providing:

### Core Benefits

- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic UI updates when data changes
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with schema validation
- **Built-in Scaling**: Automatic horizontal scaling without configuration
- **ACID Transactions**: Consistent data operations
- **Reactive Queries**: Subscriptions update automatically
- **File Storage Integration**: References to S3-stored assets

### Key Features Used

1. **Mutations**: For creating/updating logos, jobs, and presets
2. **Queries**: For fetching user data with real-time updates
3. **Actions**: For integrating with external services (S3, AI models)
4. **Scheduled Functions**: For job processing and cleanup
5. **HTTP Endpoints**: For webhook handlers and public API

### Integration Pattern

- Convex handles all database operations and real-time sync
- S3/MinIO stores actual logo files and generated assets
- Redis manages job queues for AI processing
- Convex stores metadata and references to S3 objects

---

## Clerk Authentication Integration

Clerk will be the primary authentication and user management solution throughout the application, providing:

### Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, sign-in, multi-factor authentication
- **OAuth Providers**: Google, GitHub, Microsoft, and more
- **Organizations**: Team workspaces and collaboration
- **User Management**: Profile management, user metadata, roles
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT-based sessions
- **Webhooks**: Real-time user events and synchronization

### Integration Points

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - `@clerk/nextjs` for React components and hooks
   - Protected routes using middleware
   - User context throughout the application
   - Organization switcher for team workspaces

2. **Backend (Express)**
   - `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` for API authentication
   - JWT verification for API endpoints
   - User metadata for quotas and permissions
   - Webhook handlers for user lifecycle events

3. **Database (Convex)**
   - Store Clerk user IDs in Convex documents
   - Link all user data to Clerk identities
   - Real-time sync with Convex reactive queries
   - Sync user metadata with Clerk webhooks
   - Organization data for team features
